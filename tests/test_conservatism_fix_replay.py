"""E — ship gate for the conservatism fix. The cure must not reinstate the disease: the rebalanced
signals must STILL block the desk's documented losers (5 shorts faded into risk-on; one chased
crowded-LONG BNB breakout), and the under-deployment accelerator must be structurally incapable of
amplifying the early over-trading (it only fires when FLAT + idle). LLM debates aren't
deterministically replayable, so we assert the signals that drive those decisions."""
