"""BUG fix (found live in cycle 18): the OHLCV feed returns the still-FORMING 4h candle as the last
row, but triggers and the brief's last_close/momentum must read the last COMPLETED bar — not a
transient intra-candle print. last_completed_frame drops the forming last candle when `now` falls
inside its window; it leaves an already-closed last candle untouched (and is a no-op without
now)."""
