"""Phase 4.6 CLI: re-classify the regime AFTER the analyst pass, folding the News analyst's
risk_off_flag into the deterministic news term (which preflight, running before the analysts,
could not see). Overwrites state/cycle/N/context.json's `regime_state` in place so the debate,
Trader, and gate all read the news-informed regime.

    uv run python scripts/reclassify_cli.py --cycle N

Idempotent: re-runs reproduce the same regime_state (the persistence record is keyed by cycle_no).
Fail-safe: if analyst_reports.json is absent or the news pass is empty, the regime keeps its
preflight value unchanged (news stays degraded — today's behavior).
