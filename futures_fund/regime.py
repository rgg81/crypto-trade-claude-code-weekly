"""Regime arbiter — ONE authoritative read of the tape per cycle, replacing the per-agent
re-derivation that drifted (a Watcher calling risk-off "confirmed" off stale data while the
analysts were more careful). A deterministic core (majors breadth + BTC anchor + F&G + persistence
with two-sided hysteresis) plus a symmetric, justification-gated agent override.

This is a MARKET-NEUTRAL desk: the regime NEVER gates permission to go long or short. It is a
SYMMETRIC conviction-shaper and entry-style router — a `risk_off`/`risk_on` label sizes conviction
and decides whether an entry is WITH-regime (may be at market) or COUNTER-regime (a short while not
risk_off, or a long while risk_off — must first confirm via a trigger, enforced in the orchestrator
for BOTH sides identically). `confirmed` is the advisory STRENGTH of a risk_off read, not a gate.

Fail-closed throughout: degraded feeds, missing majors, gaps, and corrupt history can WITHHOLD a
confident label (so the orchestrator requires confirmation for BOTH directions) but can NEVER
manufacture a confident regime out of thin air. The single sanctioned asymmetry is the news term
(bad>good): news_term in [-1, 0] only deepens the ADVISORY score toward risk-off (never lifts it),
so it IS a deliberate one-directional risk-off tilt — justified because bad news genuinely gaps
harder than good. It is confined to the advisory score (news-blind to the label), so it cannot gate
permission, sizing, or the counter-regime classification; its only effect is a mild risk-off lean in
the agents' read. The desk accepts this one intentional tilt; everything else is symmetric.
