"""Conditional / trigger orders — resting intents that let the desk act on its own analysis
across cycles instead of "wait and re-decide by hand" (which lost the whole SUI move: it fell
straight down, never bouncing to the 0.887 trigger that only lived in the orchestrator's head).

A trigger fires off the latest COMPLETED 4h bar (hybrid by kind: stop-entry on a CLOSE beyond the
level = a confirmed break; limit-entry on a LOW/HIGH TOUCH = a pullback fill), then becomes a
NORMAL proposal at the trigger price and routes through the EXACT existing gate (RR>=2, heat cap,
1%-sizing, liq) re-checked against the LIVE regime — no privileged path. A FIRED trigger is already
a confirmed break, so it is exempt from the gate's counter-regime confirmation transform.
