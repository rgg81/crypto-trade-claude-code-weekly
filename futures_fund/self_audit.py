"""Standing self-audit (Pillar 4 — AUDIT). A fast, deterministic panel of the desk's CRITICAL
cross-module invariants, runnable any cycle / on demand (scripts/self_audit_cli.py) as a
complement to the full test suite. It catches a regression in a load-bearing safety/symmetry/
pacing property without running 600+ tests. Pure-import checks; no I/O, no network.

This is the repeatable, deterministic core of "auditing to make sure no bugs" — distinct from (and
cheaper than) the heavy multi-agent adversarial review, whose own verify pass can fail. Every check
here is a hard invariant that MUST hold for the desk to be safe to run.
