"""Improvement metrics (Pillar 3 — IMPROVE: get sharper every cycle, and MEASURE it).

The desk already learns (reflector -> lessons -> eval harness). This adds the missing measurement:
is the desk actually getting better, and is it deploying toward 5%/week? Three read-only signals,
surfaced each cycle so the team and the WEEKLY meta-reflection can see the trend:

- DEPLOYMENT RATE — fraction of recent cycles that actually put risk on (opens or armed triggers).
  Directly measures the under-deployment that this whole pivot fixes; a near-zero rate is the alarm.
- CORPUS HEALTH — is the lessons corpus growing AND two-sided (enabling vs restrictive)? A one-way
  'don't' ratchet is the documented path to all-cash.
- RETURN TREND — recent-window mean return vs the prior window: improving, flat, or decaying.

Pure read-only (no mutation); fail-safe to empty on a thin/cold log.
